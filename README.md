# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Project
Project for Coursera Data Science Class on Getting and Cleaning Data

This repository contains a R Script run_analysis.R that reads in data sets from a Human Activity Project.
The script combines training and test files and combines them into one data set.
The script then subsets the combined file into one file with subject information, activity information and means and standard deviations on vaiables of interest.
A tidy data set of the means of the measurement variables are created by subject and activity.
